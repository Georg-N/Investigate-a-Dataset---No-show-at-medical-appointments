### Project Title
Investigate a Dataset - No-show at medical appointments

### Description
In this project I investigate a dataset on medical appointments. First the data is wrangled. Then I raise 2 research questions:
1. How does the time of scheduling the appointment affect whether the patient showed up or not
2. How do the columns with boolean variables impact whether the patient showed up or not

### Files used

### Credits
